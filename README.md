## Getting Started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/asyaasha/ethOnline.git
```

```shell
cd ethOnline
```

```shell
poetry install && poetry shell
```

0. 

```shell
autonomy packages sync
```

Which should sync up all the agent packages from IPFS

```shell

```

Now we're all setup and ready to run.

1. To access Grafana / Prometheus:

```shell
docker compose up
```

2. In another terminal: run the agent
 
```shell
make run_agent
```

At this point, one may validate whether the application is running via a simple curl

```shell
curl -X 'POST' 0.0.0.0:5555/claim -H "ContentType: application/json" -d '{"public_address": "0x92e4E69ea99c42337c3ea70a9B6aa1b6c91ba5E2", "ledger_id": "ethereum"}'
{"result": "Address has already claimed today."}
```

Turns out we were greedy during development today ðŸ˜…


3. And last but not least of all, a third terminal to start the frontend:

```shell
npm install and npm run dev
```
